## Resources

Experiments were conducted using a private infrastructure, which has a carbon efficiency of 0.432 kg CO2 eq / kWh. A cumulative of 98 hours of computation was performed on hardware of type RTX A6000 (TDP of 300W).

Total emissions are estimated to be 12.7 kg CO2 eq of which 0 percents were directly offset.

Estimations were conducted using the [MachineLearning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700).
