0	`One of the most obvious ways Kierkegaard draws from Hegel is in his use of modified Hegelian dialectic.  Sometimes he mocks this method or uses it against Hegel, and certainly he employs it in different ways than Hegel did, but he nonetheless uses this distinctly Hegelian method for positive purposes all through his work.  In Fear and Trembling, faith is described as a sort of synthesis of the aesthetic and the ethical.  The ethical individual, transcends the aesthetic, abandons its ``silence`` in favor of disclosure and abandons its hope that its desires will be fulfilled in favor of quiet resignation.  The religious individual, the knight of faith, transcends this state, but like the aesthetic individual is silent, and believes that he will receive what he desires.  The ordinary person gets finitude, his finite desires; the knight of resignation gives that up for infinity, but the knight of faith gets both.  Similarly, in The Present Age, Kierkegaard argues that what is needed is a synthesis of reflection and passion.  These ideas are very clearly influenced by Hegel's concept of dialectical synthesis.

CONTROVERSIAL?  What was is controversial regarding my listing?  There are facts Randy Campo was born in 1952 and was killed in 1992.  He was the brother of Jeanne Campo Potamkin and was the uncle of Jamin Potamkin.  There is a Randy Campo Lectureship at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, the most recent taking place Thursday 17 June 2010.  The Randy V. Campo Lecture from June 2008 is on the Bascom Palmer intenet site.  You can hear what other unrelated doctors say regarding Randy there.  The first Randy Campo Lecture, which I attended was not videotaped, but I was there and heard the speaker state, """"Randy was the Michael Jordan of Retina surgeons.""""  Randy's colleagues honor him with an AMA credited lecture, guess if the AMA considers it worth a credit toward a medical degree to learn about Randy Campo by attending the RVC Lecture, Wikipedia should (or wikipedia's loyal vandals) allow the information to be on its site.  Crap it may be controversial to state that President Kennedy was killed in an automobile accident, it is true Kennedy was killed in an automobile, now the controversy may surround that a gunmen or gunmen also had some invovlment in the death of Kennedy, so should we remove reference to the facts and just state that """"Kennedy was killed in a car"""" on the Wikipedia site?
